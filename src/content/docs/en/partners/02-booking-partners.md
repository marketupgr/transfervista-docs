Booking Partners are external businesses (e.g. hotels, travel agents) that send you bookings via a dedicated link. You can add a **commission** on top of your prices so the partner earns a share.

## New Partner form

Click **New Partner** on the Partners list. The form includes:

- **Name/Business/Title** – The name of the partner as it appears in the system and to customers.
- **Contact Name**, **Contact Email**, **Contact Phone** (optional) – Primary contact for the partner.

Then choose what the partner can do:

- **Can Book Transfers** – If enabled, this partner can book transfers with a booking link.
- **Can Book Tours** – If enabled, this partner can book tours with a booking link.
- **Is a transfer partner/operator** – If enabled, this partner can be assigned to transfers as operators; they receive assignment requests and can accept or decline. See [Transfer Operators](/docs/en/partners/03-transfer-operators).

Click **Save** to create the partner.

## Creating a Booking Partner

For a booking-only partner, add a partner and enable **Can Book Transfers** (and optionally **Can Book Tours** if you use the Tours add-on). Each partner gets:

- A **unique booking URL** they share with their customers
- Optional **address restrictions** (which pickup/drop-off addresses they can use)
- **Commission rates** (e.g. by price list group or percentage)

Commission is added to the total (e.g. 10% on €100 = €110 charged to the customer).

:::caution
Commission is added on top of your prices—the customer pays the total (e.g. 10% on €100 → €110 charged).

## Partner users

You can invite users to the partner’s dashboard so they can create and view bookings for that partner. User status (e.g. Invited, Active) can be managed from the partner’s page.
