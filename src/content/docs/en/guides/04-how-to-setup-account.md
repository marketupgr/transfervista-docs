# Get Started

This guide will walk you through the essential steps needed to set up your business inside Transfervista. By completing the steps below, you will ensure your account is fully operational and ready to receive bookings.

## 1. Add Your Drivers

Drivers are the people who complete the transfers, and each driver can have personal details, legal information, and assigned vehicles.

When you click **Add Driver**, a form like the one below will appear:

![Add Driver Form](../../../../assets/add-driver.png)

### What You Can Add for Each Driver

#### **Basic Information**
You can enter:
- **Name**
- **Email**
- **Phone number**

This allows drivers to receive booking notifications and stay connected with your team.

#### **Photo Upload**
You can upload a driver photo by:
- Dragging an image into the upload area, or  
- Clicking to browse files (maximum upload size: 8MB)

Driver photos help with internal visibility and customer transparency.

#### **Legal Information**
You can also add optional legal details:
- **Full legal name**
- **Government ID number**
- **Driver license number**

These fields help keep verified documentation organized and ensure compliance with local regulations.

#### **Assigned Vehicles**
You can assign vehicles to the driver by adding:
- **Vehicle name**
- **Plate number**

This ensures the system knows which vehicles each driver can operate when scheduling transfers.

After completing the details, click **Add** to save the driver.

## 2. Add Your Vehicles

Vehicles define the type of transfer options your business offers.

To add a vehicle:

1. Go to **Settings → Vehicles**
2. Click **Add Vehicle**
3. Enter the vehicle category, capacity, luggage space, and other details
4. Save the vehicle

These vehicles appear in the booking form and can be assigned to drivers.

## 3. Define Your Availability Zones

Availability Zones represent **the geographical areas where your business operates**.  
These zones directly determine whether a customer’s requested address is accepted or rejected.

To create zones:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Availability**
2. Go to the **Availability Zones** tab
3. Draw your operational areas on the map
4. Save the zone

### How Availability Zones Work
- If a customer enters an address **outside your zones**, the system will automatically notify them that the transfer cannot be completed.
- This ensures you only receive valid and serviceable bookings.

## 4. Define Your Areas (Fixed Locations)

Areas serve two main purposes:

### **1. Fixed Locations for the Booking Form**
Areas appear as selectable pickup/drop-off locations such as:
- Airports  
- Ports  
- Hotels  
- Popular landmarks  

### **2. Fixed Points for Route-Based Pricing**
Areas are used to create **route-based pricing** in the Price List.

To define areas:

1. Go to **Settings → Availability**
2. Open the **Areas** tab
3. Add a new area and position it on the map
4. (Optional) Assign the area to a specific Availability Zone

Areas help standardize frequent routes and simplify the booking form experience.

## 5. Set Up Your Price List

The Price List determines how much a transfer costs. You can use two methods:

### **A. Price by Route (Fixed Price)**
Choose this if you want fixed prices between two areas:
- Airport → City Center  
- Port → Hotel  
- Hotel → Airport  

### **B. Price per Kilometer**
Choose this if your pricing depends on distance.

To configure your prices:

1. Go to **Settings → Price List**
2. Choose **Price by Route** or **Price per km**
3. Add the routes or distance-based pricing rules
4. Save your price list
