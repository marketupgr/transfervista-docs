To access Areas, go to **Catalog** in the sidebar and select the **Areas** tab.

Areas are notable locations that your transfer company wants to highlight. They serve two purposes:

1. **Pricing rules** - Areas can be attached to price lists to apply special pricing for routes to or from specific locations
2. **Booking form display** - Areas can appear as selectable options in the booking form address picker, making it easier for customers to select common destinations

## Understanding Areas

Unlike the address autocomplete which lets customers type any address, Areas are predefined locations
you define by drawing zones on a map. When a customer's pickup or drop-off falls within an Area,
you can apply specific pricing rules through your [Price Lists](/docs/en/catalog/03-price-lists).

**Common use cases:**
- Airports, ports, or ferry terminals
- Hotels, resorts
- City centers with zone-based pricing

:::tip
Areas are different from [Availability Zones](/docs/en/availability/02-zones). While Areas define
locations for pricing, Availability Zones define where transfer services are offered. A transfer
company typically has fewer Availability Zones than Areas.

## Reference

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Main text** | The primary name for this area (e.g., "Athens International Airport"). This appears in the booking form when the area is shown as a selectable option. |
| **Secondary text** | Additional descriptive text (e.g., "Eleftherios Venizelos"). Helps customers identify the location. |
| **Type** | Categorize the area: **Airport**, **Port**, **Hotel / Lodging**, or **Other**. This helps organize areas and may affect how they're displayed. |
| **Show in booking form?** | When enabled, this area appears as a selectable option in the booking form address picker. Customers can select it directly instead of typing an address. |

## Area Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Airport** | International or domestic airports |
| **Port** | Ferry terminals, cruise ports, marinas |
| **Hotel / Lodging** | Hotels, resorts, vacation rental areas |
| **Other** | Train stations, landmarks, city districts, or any other notable location |

## How Areas Connect to Pricing

Areas are used in [Price Lists](/docs/en/catalog/03-price-lists) to define route-based pricing. For example:

- Airport → City Center: €45 flat rate
- City Center → Airport: €65 flat rate

When a customer books a transfer and their pickup or drop-off location falls within a defined Area, the corresponding pricing rule is applied.

## Tips

### Naming Areas

If you're showing the area on the booking form, you should use clear names that customers will understand.
Furthermore, we calculate the routes based on the area name, so **avoid using vague names** that
don't correspond to real-world locations.

- **Good**: "Athens International Airport", "Piraeus Port", "Glyfada Beach Hotels"
- **Avoid**: "Zone A", "Area 1", or internal codes

### Area Size

- Draw areas that are large enough to capture all relevant pickup/drop-off points
- For airports, include terminal access roads and nearby hotels
- For hotel districts, cover the entire area where properties are located

### Booking Form Display

Enable "Show in booking form" for locations that customers frequently search for. This saves them time and ensures accurate location selection. You might enable it for:

- Major airports and ports
- Hotel areas
