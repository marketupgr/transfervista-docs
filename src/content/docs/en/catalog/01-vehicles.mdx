## Tips

### Vehicle Images

- Use high-quality photos that clearly show the vehicle
- Consistent image styles across your fleet create a professional appearance

### Naming Vehicles

Choose clear, descriptive names that help customers understand what to expect:

- **Good**: "Standard Sedan", "Minivan", "Mercedes S-Class"
- **Avoid**: "Car 1", "Vehicle A", "8-seat Minivan", or overly technical names

### Capacity Settings

Set capacities based on comfortable travel with luggage. Vehicles are disabled for selection if the
customer's party size or luggage exceeds the set limits.
