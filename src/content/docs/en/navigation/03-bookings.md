# Bookings

The **Bookings** section allows you to manage all your transfer and tour reservations in one place. It provides tools to review, filter, and assign resources efficiently.

## Review Bookings

![Preview bookings](../../../../assets/bookings.png)


You can review each booking to see its full details. Bookings include information such as:

- Customer name  
- Flight details (arrival/departure)  
- Destination and origin  
- Partner name that booked the transfer or tour  
- Transfer/tour type  
- Status and timing

## Filter Bookings

To quickly find specific bookings, you can filter by:

- **Customer** – view bookings for a particular passenger  
- **Operator / Partner** – see bookings made by a specific partner company  
- **Flight** – filter bookings by flight number or arrival/departure times  
- **Destination** – filter by the drop-off location  
- **Origin** – filter by the pick-up location or booking partner  
- **Other details** – filter by status, date, or type of service  

Filtering makes it easier to manage large volumes of bookings and ensure nothing is missed.

## Assigning Drivers and Partners

You can assign either a **driver** or a **partner operator** to handle a booking. Each works differently:

### 1. Assigning a Driver

- When you assign a **driver**, they gain access to Transfervista with their own user view.  
- The driver can see the bookings assigned to them and click a button to **mark the pick-up as completed** and **confirm the transfer is finished**.  
- This ensures real-time tracking and updates within the platform, giving you full visibility of the transfer status.

### 2. Assigning a Partner Operator

- When you assign a **partner operator** (a company that handles transfers), each company might have its own fleet and drivers.  
- Transfervista sends an **email notification** to the company asking them to accept the booking.  
- In this case, Transfervista **does not track pick-up or drop-off** because the company manages its own drivers independently.  
- This allows external companies to handle transfers without sharing their internal operations with Transfervista, while you still keep track of which bookings are assigned.

## Summary

The Bookings section provides full control over:

- Reviewing all bookings  
- Filtering by customer, operator, flight, origin, destination, and other details  
- Assigning drivers for real-time tracking  
- Assigning partner operators for external management  

Proper use of this section ensures your transfers and tours are efficiently managed and accurately tracked.
