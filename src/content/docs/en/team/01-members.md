Team **Members** are people who log in to your TransferVista admin or driver app. From **Team > Members** (sidebar) you can view the member list, invite new members, change roles, and remove access.

## New Member form

To add someone, go to **Team > Members** and click **New Member**. The modal says: *"Invite a new member to your organization by entering their email and assigning a role."*

**Roles in the form:**

- **Managers** can manage members and settings.
- **Staff** can manage bookings but cannot change settings.
- **Drivers** can view and operate on their assigned transfers.

Enter **Role** (dropdown: Manager, Staff, or Driver), **Email**, and **Name**. Then choose:

- **Add and Send Invite** – Sends an email invitation; the member signs in via the link.
- **Add without Invite** – Adds the member without sending an email (e.g. you will share credentials another way).

:::note
The Owner role is the account owner and is not added via New Member; only Manager, Staff, and Driver can be invited.
