description: Configure role-based access permissions for drivers
---

To access Permissions, go to **Settings** in the sidebar and select **Permissions**.

Here you control what **drivers** (operators) can see when they log in. This keeps sensitive information hidden while giving them what they need to do the job.

![Settings > Permissions — Role Based Permissions and Drivers options](../../../../assets/screenshots/settings-permissions.png)

## Reference

Under **Role Based Permissions** you will see a **Drivers** section with two options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Drivers can see the total booking price** | When enabled, drivers see the booking total and payment amounts in their assignment view. Turn off to hide pricing from drivers. |
| **Drivers can see their commission for a transfer** | When enabled, drivers see their commission for each booking. Turn off to keep commission confidential. |

These options apply to the driver's view of their [assignments](/docs/en/drivers/02-viewing-assignments) and booking details.

:::note
**Who these apply to:** The Permissions toggles apply to everyone who has the **Driver** role (invited via [Team > Members](/docs/en/team/01-members)). There is one set of driver permissions for your organization; all drivers see (or don't see) price and commission according to these settings.
:::

:::tip
Drivers have a limited role: they only see their own assignments and can update status (e.g. Picked up, Completed). They do not have access to settings, catalog, billing, or other users' data.

After making changes, click **Save** in the top right corner to apply your updates.
