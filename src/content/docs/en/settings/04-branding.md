- Tours listing (if using the Tours add-on)

## Reference

| **Base Color 1** | The primary background color, typically white or a very light shade (e.g., `#FFFFFF`). |
| **Base Color 2** | A secondary background color for alternating sections or cards (e.g., `#F2F7FE`). |
| **Base Color 3** | A tertiary background color for borders, dividers, or subtle highlights (e.g., `#E3E9F4`). |
| **Base Text Color** | The main text color used throughout the booking form (e.g., `#394E6A`). |

## Tips

Here's some guidance to help you choose the best branding elements

### Logo

- Use a high-resolution image for clarity.
- A transparent background (PNG) helps the logo blend seamlessly with different background colors.
- Your logo is displayed on white or light backgrounds, so ensure it is clearly visible.
- Avoid square logos, as they may appear small in the header area. A rectangular logo with a width greater than its height works best.

### Color Scheme

You may override the default colors with your own brand colors.
The Brand Color should be a prominent color from your logo or brand palette.
Base Colors should be neutral, they are used for backgrounds and are shades of white/gray.

:::tip
Choose colors that provide good contrast for readability. Your brand color should stand out against the base colors, and the text color should be easily readable on all background colors.
