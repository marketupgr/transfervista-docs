## Automatic Customer Creation

Whenever a booking is made in Transfervista, a new customer record is automatically created if the customer does not already exist.  

This ensures that every passenger or client is tracked in the system without requiring manual input every time.

Once created, you can:

- View all customer profiles  
- Edit details such as contact information, notes, and address  
- Search and filter customers to quickly find the right one  

Proper customer management helps streamline bookings, communication, and reporting.
