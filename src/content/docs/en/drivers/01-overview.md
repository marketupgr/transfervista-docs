description: Introduction to the driver interface in TransferVista
---

The Driver Experience section of the docs describes how **drivers** (operators) use TransferVista. Drivers log in with their own account to view assignments and update booking status—no need to use the full admin panel.

## What drivers see when they log in

After logging in, drivers land on the **Dashboard** with an **Assignments** section. The dashboard shows:

- **Transfers** – Current and upcoming transfers assigned to them. Each line shows the booking reference, status (e.g. Assigned), customer name, pickup location, and pickup date and time (and flight number when provided).
- **Tours** – Current tour assignments, if any, with period stats.
- **Previous Assignments** – Completed transfers for reference.

Drivers can tap or click an assignment to open the full transfer details, then update status to **Picked up** when they collect the customer and **Completed** when the journey ends.

:::note
**Mobile-friendly:** The driver interface is designed for use on phones and tablets. The layout works well on the road—drivers can view assignments, open details, use **Navigate** for directions, and update status (Picked up, Completed) from their device.

## Driver permissions

What drivers can see and do is controlled by your [Settings > Permissions](/docs/en/settings/05-permissions) (e.g. whether they can see prices or commission). They do **not** have access to settings, catalog, billing, or other users’ bookings—only their own assignments.
