# Members

The **Members** section allows you to manage all users who interact with the Transfervista platform. Members are divided into three main categories, each with different permissions and roles.

## 1. Administrators

Administrators have full access to the system. They can:

- Manage all bookings, customers, coupons, and reports  
- Configure system-wide settings  
- Assign drivers and partners  
- View all activities across the platform  

Administrators are responsible for overall system management and monitoring.

## 2. Drivers

Drivers are users who are assigned to specific transfers or tours. Once assigned, they can:

- Log in to their own view in Transfervista  
- See all transfers and tours assigned to them  
- Perform actions such as **marking a pickup as completed** or **confirming the delivery of a passenger**  

Drivers do not have access to global system settings or other users’ data; their access is limited to the transfers they are responsible for.

## 3. Partners

Partners are external collaborators and are divided into three types:

### a) Booking Partners

- These are partners like hotels, accommodations, travel agencies, or any business that can **book transfers or tours**.  
- They send bookings to Transfervista but do not handle the execution themselves.

### b) Operator Partners

- Companies that **receive bookings to execute transfers or tours** using their own fleet and drivers.  
- Transfervista sends an **email notification** to the company asking them to accept the booking.  
- Because the operator uses their own drivers, Transfervista **does not know which driver is assigned**, only that the company will fulfill the transfer.

### c) Combined Partners

- These partners can **both book and execute transfers or tours**.  
- They have access to create bookings and also manage drivers to complete the services.

Managing members correctly ensures smooth operations, clear responsibilities, and proper tracking of all transfers and tours.
